# Hash-Function-Generation-Image-encryption
Developed by Manish Kumar
Hello there,
I am Manish Kumar, a student at Galgotias University and 
I have discovered a method to increase the complexity of key generation which is nearly impossible to crack,
compared to other standard methods my method includes high random dataset which is nearly impossible to guess.
